AI agent guide for this repository. Covers behavioral rules, architecture, and
common task playbooks.

## Behavioral Guidelines

**These come first because they prevent the most mistakes.**

### 1. Think Before Coding

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them—don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.

### 2. Simplicity First

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

### 3. Surgical Changes

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated issues, mention them—don't fix them.
- Remove only what YOUR changes made unused.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

- Transform tasks into verifiable goals.
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with verification steps.
- Unverified work is incomplete work.

### 5. Output Precision

- Lead with findings, not process descriptions.
- Use structured formats (lists, tables, code blocks).
- Include absolute file paths—never relative.

## Overview

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn (`apps/frontend/`)
- **Desktop**: Tauri/Rust with SQLite (`apps/tauri/`, `crates/`)
- **Web mode**: Axum HTTP server (`apps/server/`)
- **Packages**: `@wealthfolio/ui`, addon-sdk, addon-dev-tools (`packages/`)

## Run Targets

| Task         | Command            |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Desktop dev  | `pnpm tauri dev`   |
| Web dev      | `pnpm run dev:web` |
| Tests (TS)   | `pnpm test`        |
| Tests (Rust) | `cargo test`       |
| Type check   | `pnpm type-check`  |
| Lint         | `pnpm lint`        |
| All checks   | `pnpm check`       |

## Agent Playbook

### Adding a feature with backend data

1. **Frontend route/UI** → `apps/frontend/src/pages/`,
   `apps/frontend/src/routes.tsx`
2. **Command wrapper** → `apps/frontend/src/commands/<domain>.ts` (follow
   `RUN_ENV` pattern)
3. **Tauri command** → `apps/tauri/src/commands/*.rs`, wire in `mod.rs` +
   `lib.rs`
4. **Web endpoint** → `apps/server/src/api/`, call `crates/core` service
5. **Core logic** → `crates/core/` services/repos
6. **Tests** → Vitest for TS, `#[test]` for Rust

### UI patterns

- Components: `@wealthfolio/ui` and `packages/ui/src/components/`
- Forms: `react-hook-form` + `zod` schemas from
  `apps/frontend/src/lib/schemas.ts`
- Theme: tokens in `apps/frontend/src/globals.css`

### Architecture pattern

```
Frontend → Adapter (tauri/web) → Command wrapper
                ↓
        Tauri IPC  |  Axum HTTP
                ↓
           crates/core (business logic)
                ↓
           crates/storage-sqlite
```

### Cleaning up Wealthfolio Dev for a fresh start

Both `pnpm tauri dev` and built DMGs use the same app identifier
(`com.teymz.wealthfolio.dev`), so they share the same data directories.

**Data locations (macOS):**

- `~/Library/Application Support/com.teymz.wealthfolio.dev/` — SQLite database (`app.db`) and backups
- `~/Library/Caches/com.teymz.wealthfolio.dev/` — WebKit cache
- `~/Library/Preferences/com.teymz.wealthfolio.dev.plist` — App preferences
- `~/Library/Saved Application State/com.teymz.wealthfolio.dev.savedState/` — Window state

**To reset completely:**

1. Quit Wealthfolio Dev
2. Run:
   ```sh
   ./scripts/clean-dev-data.sh
   ```
3. Restart the app — a fresh database will be created

**Note:** If you opened a `.dmg` file, it mounts as a virtual disk in `/Volumes/`.
The script will detect and eject mounted DMGs automatically.

## Conventions

### TypeScript

- Strict mode, no unused locals/params
- Prefer interfaces over types, avoid enums
- Functional components, named exports
- Directory names: lowercase-with-dashes

### Rust

- Idiomatic Rust, small focused functions
- `Result`/`Option`, propagate with `?`, `thiserror` for domain errors
- Keep Tauri/Axum commands thin—delegate to `crates/core`
- Migrations in `crates/storage-sqlite/migrations`

### Security

- All data local (SQLite), no cloud
- Secrets via OS keyring—never disk/localStorage
- Never log secrets or financial data

---

## Validation Checklist

Before completing any task:

- [ ] Builds: `pnpm build` or `pnpm tauri dev` or `cargo check`
- [ ] Tests pass: `pnpm test` and/or `cargo test`
- [ ] Both desktop and web compile if touching shared code
- [ ] Changes are minimal and surgical

---

## Plan Mode

- Make plans extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for brevity.
- End with unresolved questions, if any.

---

When in doubt, follow the nearest existing pattern.
